SETUP:
Step 1: Initialize. Create a population of N elements, each with randomly generated DNA.
LOOP:
Step 2: Selection. Evaluate the fitness of each element of the population and build a mating
pool.
Step 3: Reproduction. Repeat N times:
a) Pick two parents with probability according to relative fitness.
b) Crossover—create a “child” by combining the DNA of these two parents.
c) Mutation—mutate the child’s DNA based on a given probability.
d) Add the new child to a new population.
Step 4. Replace the old population with the new population and return to Step 2.
